# DLPTools

And R package for basic DLP+ data manipulation and plotting. Basically just a collection of the various functions we have been using to handle DLP data.

## Main Functions

A lot of the import functions are based on the idea that you have downloaded your dlp something like this:

```bash
cd where/to/save/my_dlp/

for ticket in "$@" ; 
do
  azcopy copy https://singlecellresults.blob.core.windows.net/results/${ticket}/results/annotation/ ${ticket} --recursive
  azcopy copy https://singlecellresults.blob.core.windows.net/results/${ticket}/results/hmmcopy/ ${ticket} --recursive
done
```

which produces a directory with this sort of structure:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ SC-8382
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotation
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metrics.csv.gz
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ #[...other files ...]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hmmcopy
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ #[...other files ...]
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ reads.csv.gz
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ reads.csv.gz.yaml
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ reads_filtered.csv.gz
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ segments.csv.gz
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ segments.csv.gz.yaml
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ segments_filtered.csv.gz
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ segs.tar.gz
â”œâ”€â”€ SC-8408
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotation
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metrics.csv.gz
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ #[...other files ...]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hmmcopy
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ #[...other files ...]
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ reads.csv.gz
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ reads.csv.gz.yaml
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ reads_filtered.csv.gz
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ segments.csv.gz
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ segments.csv.gz.yaml
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ segments_filtered.csv.gz
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ segs.tar.gz
â”œâ”€â”€ SC-8650
```


As well, a lot of functions require external files that are too big to package effectively (TODO: maybe add downloads as a function?).

```bash
# centromere file
wget https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/cytoBand.txt.gz

# HG19 chromsome length information
wget https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/chromInfo.txt.gz

# information on where telomeres start and end
wget https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/gap.txt.gz
```



## Development

```bash
# 1. clone the repo

git clone URL

# 2. install the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 3. code happy.
```


If you haven't worked on an R package before, [this](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html) is a good read to get started.

To add functions, we can rely on `library(devtools)` to help with the metadata stuff and package construction. Steps include:

1. boot an R instance and set the working directory to wherever you cloned this repo

```R
setwd("/path/to/dlptools/")
library(devtools)
```

2. add your R function either within an existing `R/*R` module, or create a new module

```
vim R/my_new_module.R
```

```R
# add your function, with documentation in roxygen style! See other funcs for 
# examples.

#' the thing my function does
#'
# my function does this great thing
#' 
#' @param x a description of the arg for my function
#' @export
my_cool_func <- function(x) {
    return(x)
}
```

3. Then in your R instance, we can build the needed meta data for the new function.

```R
# searches the R/ directory for new functions and updates the NAMESPACE file.
# also creates .Rd files based on your function docstring.
devtools::document()
```

4. From the R instance, run a check that the package is still good

```R
devtools::check()
```

5. ideally we write unit tests ðŸ˜¬

https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html#use_testthat

6. commit your changes to the repo

```bash
git status # to see what is all changed

git add R/my_new_module.R
# and probably the other files that the package updated
git add NAMESPACE
git add man/my_cool_func.R
git commit
# and battle it out with the pre-commit hooks...the R ones are painfully slow

# write a GOOD commit message. For inspiration look at other commits and 
# checkout https://cbea.ms/git-commit/
# also try to include the type of thing being committed, i.e.,
# conventional commits style: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
